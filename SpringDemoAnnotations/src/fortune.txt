watch for the man in black
you will fin much fortune
can do with the wait and yes
give him the ol dick twist
you can do better than that
don't do it, you know what I'm talking about
don't find time make time
help I'm stuck in a tree and they turned me into a fortune
you know what you did
you know when you think the thing, yeah its true
don't think the thing or you'll mess up
